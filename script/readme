== old gcard file using simplified SoLID simulation in graphic mode (outdated)===
solid_JPsi_LH2.gcard
solid_JPsi_simple.gcard
solid_PVDIS_LD2.gcard
solid_PVDIS_simple.gcard
solid_SIDIS_He3.gcard
solid_SIDIS_He3_simple.gcard
solid_SIDIS_NH3.gcard
solid_SIDIS_NH3_simple.gcard

== geant4 macro which can be called in gcard==

solid_slice.vis

solid_slice_nohit.vis   (gemc 2.3 will do segmentation fault using this)

== farm script ==

scripts to run full simulation in batch mode are under "farm", see readme there
